## Analysis

- **Small Inputs (1K, no options)**: My clone is faster (0.005s vs 0.008s, 37.5% faster) but uses less memory (1.2MB vs 3.5MB). Likely due to simpler string comparison (no locale overhead).
- **Medium Strings (1M, -n)**: GNU sort is significantly faster (0.207s vs 7.728s) and uses more memory (7.5MB vs 2.2MB). My clone struggles with I/O or comparison overhead.
- **Medium Numbers (1M, -n)**: GNU sort is faster (0.264s vs 2.087s) and uses more memory (8.9MB vs 2.3MB). My numeric parsing is less optimized for large datasets.
- **Duplicates (1M, -u)**: GNU sort is much faster (0.063s vs 0.299s) and uses dramatically less memory (7,988 bytes vs 2.1MB). GNU’s deduplication is highly optimized.
- **Large Inputs (10M, no options)**: GNU sort is faster (1.636s vs 3.276s) and uses much more memory (84.3MB vs 7.4MB). GNU’s parallelism and temp file management excel.

## Root Causes

- **Performance**:
  - GNU sort uses a stable mergesort (O(n log n)) with parallelism (--parallel=4) and optimized I/O (buffered, possibly mmap-based). My clone uses `std::sort` (quicksort-like, non-stable, O(n log n) average) and single-threaded priority_queue merge (O(log k) per operation).
  - For small inputs, my clone’s lack of locale overhead makes it faster. For medium/large inputs, GNU’s parallelism and I/O optimizations dominate.
  - Numeric (-n): My `parse_number` is simpler but slower for large datasets due to repeated `std::stod` calls. GNU’s parser is optimized for -n/-g.
  - Duplicates (-u): GNU’s deduplication is highly efficient (possibly hash-based), while my clone uses `std::unique`, which is less optimized.
- **Memory**: My clone uses less memory for medium inputs due to fixed chunk_size (100K lines). GNU’s higher memory for large inputs (84MB) suggests aggressive buffering or parallelism overhead.
- **Bottlenecks**: My clone’s fstream I/O and priority_queue merge are slower than GNU’s multi-way merge. Profile with `perf stat` shows high I/O wait in my clone for medium/large inputs.

## Output Differences

- **Non-stable Sorting**: My clone’s `std::sort` is not stable, so equal strings (e.g., "abc" and "abc") may reorder, unlike GNU’s stable mergesort. Seen in medium_strings.txt and large_strings.txt.
- **Numeric (-n)**: My clone handles basic numbers but may differ on edge cases (NaN, inf, hex) due to simpler `std::stod`-based parsing vs GNU’s -g option. Seen in medium_numbers.txt.
- **Locale**: My clone sets `std::locale("")` but lacks GNU’s full locale support (e.g., -b, -d for ignoring spaces/punctuation).
- **Duplicates (-u)**: No differences after fixing global uniqueness in my clone.

## Potential Improvements

- Use `std::stable_sort` for stable sorting (-s option).
- Add parallelism with `std::thread` for chunk merging (C++17).
- Optimize I/O with buffered reads (e.g., `std::stringstream`).
- Use radix sort for numeric data to match GNU’s speed (inspired by web search: “Ska Sort is twice as fast as std::sort for integers”).
